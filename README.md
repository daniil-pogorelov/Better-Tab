## 🚀 What is BetterTab?
**BetterTab** is a native macOS utility designed to replace the default `Command + Tab` switcher. It is built for developers, power users, and anyone who wants to navigate their Mac faster without touching the mouse.

Unlike **AltTab** or **Contexts**, BetterTab focuses on **keyboard-first navigation** using fuzzy search and custom bindings.

### Why replace your Mac App Switcher?
- **Stop Cycling:** Don't press `Tab` 20 times to find a window. Just type "Code" or "Spot" to jump instantly.
- **Muscle Memory:** Assign permanent hotkeys (e.g., `Option+C` for VS Code) so your apps are always one keystroke away.
- **Visual Clarity:** See exactly which window you are switching to, not just a generic app icon.

## ✨ Key Features (v2 Pro)
- **⚡️ Instant Fuzzy Search:** Type partial names to filter running apps immediately.
- **⌨️ App-Specific Hotkeys:** Define global shortcuts profiles to focus specific apps instantly.
- **🖥️ Good Looking:** Looking close to the original macOS switcher.
- **🎨 Custom Themes:** Beautiful UI that matches your macOS Light or Dark mode perfectly.
- **🍏 Native Performance:** Written in Swift for zero lag and minimal battery usage.

## 📥 Installation & Usage
### For v2 (Recommended)
1. Purchase and download the latest version from [**Gumroad**](https://2139130240062.gumroad.com/l/BetterTab).
2. Drag `BetterTab.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Grant **Accessibility Permissions** when prompted (required to control windows).

### For v1 (Legacy)
You can build the legacy version from source by visiting the [**v1 Branch**](https://github.com/daniil-pogorelov/Better-Tab/tree/v1).
